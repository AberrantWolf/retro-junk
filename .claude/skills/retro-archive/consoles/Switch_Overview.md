## Archival Storage
### Recommended Formats
- **.xci**: Cartridge dumps (complete with certificate)
- **.nsp**: Nintendo Submission Package (eShop format)
- **.nca**: Nintendo Content Archive (individual content files)

### Best Practices
- Preserve cartridge dumps with certificates intact
- Archive eShop titles before delisting
- Include update and DLC data separately
- Document firmware requirements
- Preserve save data encryption keys when possible

## Emulation Storage
### Recommended Formats
- **.xci**: Preferred for cartridge-based games
- **.nsp**: Required for eShop titles
- **Extracted folders**: For development and modding

### Considerations
- Yuzu was shut down March 2024 after Nintendo of America v. Tropic Haze LLC settled for $2.4M ([court settlement](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cod.240704/gov.uscourts.cod.240704.56.0.pdf)); Ryujinx voluntarily shut down October 2024 after Nintendo contact; community forks exist but the emulation landscape is unstable
- Requires system firmware files
- Save data encryption complicates preservation
- Performance varies significantly by title
- Legal considerations for current-generation console

## Digital Storage Considerations
- **Space Requirements**: Very high - modern games 1-32GB each
- **Backup Strategy**: Essential for digital purchases
- **Organization**: Separate cartridge dumps from eShop titles
- **Metadata**: Use scene databases with caution
- **Legal Issues**: Current generation raises legal concerns
- **Future-Proofing**: Format standards still evolving
